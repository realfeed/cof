## COF React-Native: Getting Started Guide

The purpose of this application is to provide an intuitive and engaging tool to collect and interpret occupant feedback from non-domestic buildings in real-time.

The current design intent encourages a dialogue between operator and occupant in response to feedback given and allows occupants to contribute towards summary performance metrics based upon user experience for any non-domestic in the world. These metrics are intended to nudge operators to participate â€“ for which we can charge a fee. This tool has the potential for general release and explosive growth that may supersede typical functionality of FM Service Desk.

The value proposition is that this tool will improve cooperation between building operator and occupant to enhance building performance.
